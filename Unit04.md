**Unit 4: Derivatives and Graphs** <span id="4"></span> 
*A visual person should find this unit extremely helpful in
understanding the concepts of calculus, as a major emphasis in this unit
is to display those concepts graphically. That allows us to see what, so
far, we could only imagine. Graphs help us to visualize ideas that are
hard enough to conceptualize - like limits going to infinity but still
having a finite meaning, or asymptotes - lines that approach each other
but never quite get there.*  
  
 *Graphs can also be used in a kind of reverse by displaying something
for which we should take another mathematical look. It is hard enough to
imagine a limit going to infinity, and therefore never quite getting
there, but the graph can tell us that it has a finite value, when it
finally does get there, so we had better take a serious look at it
mathematically.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   state whether a given point on a graph is a global/local
    maximum/minimum;  
      
-   find critical points and extreme values (max/min) of functions by
    using derivatives;  
      
-   determine the values of a function guaranteed to exist by Rolle’s
    Theorem and by the Mean Value Theorem;  
      
-   use the graph of f(x) to sketch the shape of the graph of f(x);  
      
-   use the values of f’(x) to sketch the graph of f(x) and state
    whether f(x) is increasing or decreasing at a point;  
      
-   use the values of f²(x) to determine the concavity of the graph of
    f(x);  
      
-   use the graph of f(x) to determine if f²(x) is positive, negative,
    or zero;  
      
-   solve maximum and minimum problems by using derivatives;  
      
-   restate in words the meanings of the solutions to applied problems,
    attaching the appropriate units to an answer;  
      
-   determine asymptotes of a function by using limits; and  
      
-   determine the values of indeterminant form limits by using
    derivatives and L’Hopital’s Rule.
