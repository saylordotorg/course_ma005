Course Syllabus for "MA005: Calculus 1"
---------------------------------------

Calculus can be thought of as the mathematics of CHANGE. Because
everything in the world is changing, calculus helps us track those
changes. Algebra, by contrast, can be thought of as dealing with a large
set of numbers that are inherently CONSTANT. Solving an algebra problem,
like *y* = 2*x* + 5, merely produces a pairing of two predetermined
numbers, although an infinite set of pairs. Algebra is even useful in
rate problems, such as calculating how the money in your savings account
increases because of the interest rate *R*, such as *Y* =
*X*<sub>0</sub>+*Rt*, where *t* is elapsed time and *X*<sub>0</sub> is
the initial deposit. With compound interest, things get complicated for
algebra, as the rate *R* is itself a function of time with *Y* =
*X*<sub>0 </sub>+ *R(t)t*. Now we have a rate of change which itself is
changing. Calculus came to the rescue, as Isaac Newton introduced the
world to mathematics specifically designed to handle those things that
change. Calculus is among the most important and useful developments of
human thought. Even though it is over 300 years old, it is still
considered the beginning and cornerstone of modern mathematics. It is a
wonderful, beautiful, and useful set of ideas and techniques. You will
see the fundamental ideas of this course over and over again in future
courses in mathematics as well as in all of the sciences (e.g.,
physical, biological, social, economic, and engineering). However,
calculus is an intellectual step up from your previous mathematics
courses. Many of the ideas you will gain in this course are more
carefully defined and have both a functional and a graphical meaning.
Some of the algorithms are quite complicated, and in many cases, you
will need to make a decision as to which appropriate algorithm to use.
Calculus offers a huge variety of applications and many of them will be
saved for courses you might take in the future. This course is divided
into five learning sections, or units, plus a reference section, or
appendix. The course begins with a unit that provides a review of
algebra specifically designed to help and prepare you for the study of
calculus. The second unit discusses functions, graphs, limits, and
continuity. Understanding limits could not be more important, as that
topic really begins the study of calculus. The third unit introduces and
explains derivatives. With derivatives, we are now ready to handle all
of those things that change mentioned above. The fourth unit makes
visual sense of derivatives by discussing derivatives and graphs. The
fifth unit introduces and explains antiderivatives and definite
integrals. Finally, the reference section provides a large collection of
reference facts, geometry, and trigonometry that will assist you in
solving calculus problems long after the course is over. **This course
provides students the opportunity to earn actual college credit. It has
been reviewed and recommended for 4 credit hours by [The National
College Credit Recommendation Service](http://www.nationalccrs.org/)
(NCCRS). While credit is not guaranteed at all schools, we have
[partnered](http://www.saylor.org/partner-schools/) with a number of
schools who have expressed their willingness to accept transfer of
credits earned through Saylor. You can read more about our NCCRS program
[here](http://www.saylor.org/student-credit-pathways/nccrs/).**

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   calculate or estimate limits of functions given by formulas, graphs,
    or tables by using properties of limits and L’Hopital’s Rule;
-   state whether a function given by a graph or formula is continuous
    or differentiable at a given point or on a given interval, and
    justify the answer;
-   calculate average and instantaneous rates of change in context, and
    state the meaning and units of the derivative for functions given
    graphically;
-   calculate derivatives of polynomial, rational, and common
    transcendental functions, compositions thereof, and implicitly
    defined functions;
-   apply the ideas and techniques of derivatives to solve maximum and
    minimum problems and related rate problems, and calculate slopes and
    rates for functions given as parametric equations;
-   find extreme values of modeling functions given by formulas or
    graphs;
-   predict, construct, and interpret the shapes of graphs;
-   solve equations using Newton’s method;
-   find linear approximations to functions using differentials;
-   restate in words the meanings of the solutions to applied problems,
    attaching the appropriate units to an answer;
-   state which parts of a mathematical statement are assumptions, such
    as hypotheses, and which parts are conclusions;
-   find antiderivatives by changing variables and using tables; and
-   calculate definite integrals.

### Course Information

**Welcome to MA005:** Calculus I. General information about this course
and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer: **Lenny Tevlin  
    
 **Primary Resources: **While this course comprises a range of different
free, online materials, the primary source used for this course is:  

-   Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges: Dale
    Hoffman’s *[Contemporary
    Calculus](http://www.saylor.org/content/WSBCTC/WSBCTC_Calculus.pdf)*

The chapters and sections of the original text have been reorganized and
carefully aligned with the course subunits so that while solving any
mathematical problem, the theory you might need to solve the problem is
only a page or two away. The best way to proceed through the course is
to read the assigned section in the order it is presented. You may
download each assigned reading as you work through each subunit. If you
prefer to download the entire text for the course, remember to refer to
the reading titles, rather than the section or page numbers as these
have been revised for the purpose of this course. Be advised that,
depending upon your Internet speed, the file can take a couple of
minutes to download, as it contains 329 pages and more than 300
megabytes of file size.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. You will also need to complete problem sets in each unit
and the final exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the problems presented for solution.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **We recommend that you dedicate approximately 2 or
3 hours of work every weeknight and 6 or 7 hours each weekend if you
expect to perform highly in this course.  
    
 This course should take you a total of approximately 130.75 hours to
complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories, determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 7.75 hours. Perhaps you can sit down
with your calendar and decide to complete Subunit 1.1 and Subunit 1.2 (a
total of 2.5 hours) on Monday night; Subunit 1.3 and Subunit 1.4 (a
total of 3.5 hours) on Tuesday night; Subunit 1.5 and the unit
assessment (a total of 1.75 hours) on Wednesday night; and so forth.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions: **Calculus takes time. Most people who fail a
calculus course do so because they are unwilling, or unable, to devote
the necessary time to the course.

-   *Do not skip topics. *The understanding of calculus is typically
    sequential. It is very difficult to understand one topic after
    lightly skipping over a preceding topic. 
-   *Test yourself. *You are testing yourself when you follow the
    procedure of always solving a problem independently BEFORE looking
    at a solution of the same.
-   *Work on details. *Focus on the parts you missed. Determine what you
    did not understand before moving on.
-   While taking the final exam, you are welcome to make use of
    this [Formula
    Sheet](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MA005-Final-Exam-Formula-Sheet.pdf) (PDF).
