**Unit 6: Appendix** <span id="6"></span> 
*By reviewing and having access to this unit, you will have an
invaluable list of references to assist you in solving future calculus
problems after this course has ended. It is a standard experience, when
solving calculus problems on your own, to react to the new problem with
the following: “We did not solve that kind of problem in the course.”
Ah, but we did, in that the new problem is often a combination, or
composition, of two problem types that were covered.*  
  
 *The course could not cover all possible trigonometric functions you
will encounter. If you encounter a need for the derivative of*
tan(x),*it is sufficient to recall that* tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)*and that
sine and cosine were covered. You can eventually become so good at this
that future calculus problems can almost seem to be little more than
plugging into formulas.*  
  
 *Engineering students, who have to take several courses that involve
the use of calculus, are noted for having a [Table of
Integrals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_integrals) on their hip
wherever they go, such as this one posted on Wikipedia.\**

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit does not have readings and assigned problems and is provided
as a resource to take with you as the course ends. Making printed copies
might be a good idea.

    Colleges: Dale Hoffman’s *Contemporary Calculus*: “Section 6.1:
    Calculus Reference”**
    Link: Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges:

    Reference”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MA005-6.1-Calculus-Reference.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: There are neither readings nor problems associated
    with this section. Rather, it consists of two pages of formulas that
    can be useful to you in your further explorations of calculus,
    including the final exam. You should be able to quickly print out
    these two pages or save them where they can be easily located as a
    quick reference when needed.

     **Please note that because this exam has the possibility to be a
    credit-bearing exam, it must be administered in a proctored
    environment, and is therefore password protected.** Further

     If you choose to take this exam, you may want to first take the
    regular, certificate-bearing MA005 Final Exam as a practice test,
    which you can find above.
