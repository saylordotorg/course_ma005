**Unit 3: Derivatives** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we start to see calculus become more visible when
abstract ideas such as a derivative and a limit appear as parts of
slopes, lines, and curves. Then, there are circles, ellipses, and
parabolas that are even more geometric, so what was previously an
abstract concept can now be something we can see. Nothing makes calculus
more tangible than to recognize that the first derivative of an
automobile’s position is its velocity and the second derivative of that
position is its acceleration. We are at the very point that started
Isaac Newton on his quest to master this mathematics, what we now call
calculus, when he recognized that the second derivative was precisely
what he needed to formulate his Second Law of Motion* F = MA*, where*
F*is the force on any object,* M*is its mass, and* A *is the second
derivative of its position. Thus, he could connect all the variables of
a moving object mathematically, including its acceleration, velocity,
and position, and he could explain what really makes motion happen.*
