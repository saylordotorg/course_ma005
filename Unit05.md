**Unit 5: The Integral** <span id="5"></span> 
*While previous units dealt with* differential calculus*, this unit
starts the study of* integral calculus*. As you may recall, differential
calculus began with the development of the intuition behind the notion
of a tangent line. Integral calculus begins with understanding the
intuition behind the notion of an* area.*In fact, we will be able to
extend the notion of the area and apply these more general areas to a
variety of problems. This will allow us to unify differential and
integral calculus through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Historically, this theorem marked the beginning of modern mathematics
and is extremely important in all applications.*

     Instructions: Read Section 5.7 on pages 1 - 9 to see how one can
    (sometimes) find an antiderivative. In particular, we will discuss
    the *change of variable* technique. Change of variable, also called
    substitution or *u*-substitution (for the most commonly-used
    variable), is a powerful technique that you will use time and again
    in integration. It allows you to simplify a complicated function to
    show how basic rules of integration apply to the function. Work
    through practice problems 1 - 4. For solutions to these problems,
    see page 12 and page 13.  
        
     Reading this section and completing the practice problems should
    take approximately 1 hour.
