**Unit 2: Functions, Graphs, Limits, and Continuity** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The concepts of continuity and the meaning of a limit form the
foundation for all of calculus. Not only must you understand both of
these concepts individually, but you must understand how they relate to
each other. They are a kind of Siamese twins in calculus problems, as we
always hope they show up together.*  
  
 *A student taking a calculus course during a winter term came up with
the best analogy that I have ever heard for tying these concepts
together: The weather was raining ice - the kind of weather in which no
human being in his right mind would be driving a car. When he stepped
out on the front porch to see whether the ice-rain had stopped, he could
not believe his eyes when he saw the headlights of an automobile heading
down his road, which ended in a dead end at a brick house. When the car
hit the brakes, the student’s intuitive mind concluded that at the rate
at which the velocity was decreasing (assuming continuity), there was no
way the car could stop in time and it would hit the house (the limiting
value). Oops. He forgot that there was a gravel stretch at the end of
the road and the car stopped many feet from the brick house. The gravel
represented a discontinuity in his calculations, so his limiting value
was not correct.*

    (Rationalization)”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVLyE_UEfxs) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch this video on finding limits algebraically. Be
    warned that removing *x* - 4 from the numerator and denominator in
    Step 4 of this video is only legal inside this limit. The function
    (*x* - 4)/(*x* - 4) is not defined at *x* = 4; however, when *x* is
    not 4, it simplifies to 1. Because the limit as *x* approaches 4
    depends only on values of *x* different from 4, inside that limit
    (*x* - 4)/(*x* - 4) and 1 are interchangeable. Outside that limit,
    they are not! However, this kind of cancellation is a key technique
    for finding limits of algebraically complicated functions.  
        
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch this video on limits as the slopes of tangent
    lines.  
        
     An earlier Khan Academy video (not used in this course) defined the
    limit that gives the slope of the tangent line to a curve as *y* =
    *f(x)* at a point *x* = *a* and called it the derivative of *f(x)*
    at *a*. Your text will introduce this term in Unit 3.
