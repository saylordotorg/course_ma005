**Unit 1: Preview and Review** <span id="1"></span> 
*While a first course in calculus can strike you as something new to
learn, it is not comparable to learning a foreign language where
everything seems different. Calculus still depends on most of the things
you learned in algebra, and the true genius of Isaac Newton was to
realize that he could get answers for this something new by relying on
simple and known things like graphs, geometry, and algebra. There is a
need to review those concepts in this unit, where a graph can reinforce
the adage that a picture is worth one thousand words. This unit starts
right off with one of the most important steps in mastering problem
solving: Have a clear and precise statement of what the problem really
is about.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 7.75 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 0.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 2 hours

 ☐    Subunit 1.4: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.5: 1.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Unit 1 Assessment: 0.5 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   approximate a slope of a tangent line from a function given as a
    graph;  
      
-   approximate the area of an irregular figure by counting inside
    squares;  
      
-   calculate the slope of the line through two points;  
      
-   write the equation of the line through two points using both
    slope-intercept and point-slope forms;  
      
-   write the equation of a circle with a given center and radius;  
      
-   evaluate a function at a point, given by a formula, graph, table, or
    words;  
      
-   evaluate a combination, or a composition, of functions when
    indicated by the symbols +, - , \*, /;  
      
-   evaluate and graph the elementary functions as well as |x| and
    INT(x);  
      
-   state whether a given “if-then” statement is true or false, and
    justify the answer;  
      
-   state which parts of a mathematical statement are assumptions, or
    hypotheses, and which are conclusions; and  
      
-   state the contrapositive form of an “if-then” statement.
